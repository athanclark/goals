\section{General Ideas}

Generally speaking, there are four major categories for the ideas just discussed:

\begin{itemize}
\item USMC Related --- How I will spend my next four years in the Corps, and how I can change it, and likewise
  how it could change me.
\item Interpersonal --- How I could improve my professional and personal relationships with people; work better,
  be trustworthy, and gain more trust from people (where deserved).
\item Personal --- How I should decide the value and importance of certain goals; I should be capable of deciding
  which ones are worth prioritizing over others, whether personal or Corps related.
\item Productivity --- I should always be trying to improve my workflow and accomplish tasks faster; furthermore,
  with better planning and decision making from the Personal category, I may improve how I process goals.
\end{itemize}
