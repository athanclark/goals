Analysis
========

Here, I'll divulge into specific goals after digressing on the value of
the statements made in the previous chapter.

USMC Related
------------

There are some very specific goals I'd like to achieve in my first (and
possibly, only) enlistment - some of them for glory, and some
cathartic; but overall, I would like to see myself successful in this
organization. A lot of it stems from the pride of my family, but a lot
comes from myself as well; joining the USMC feels like the best thing
I've ever done for myself (on good days...on bad, it feels like the
worst).

At any rate, being proud of my uniform and my belonging are fundamental
to my presence in the Corps, and I'll need to keep those values strong.

-   Reach the rank of Sergeant - My cousin is a Sergeant, but that's
    not why I want to be one...I feel like its your *responsibility* as
    enlisted to reach that rank; to be a *servant* to the Corps (and a
    valued one, at that).

-   Achieve an associates degree in computer science and electrical
    engineering - I already know so much about these fields, that they
    should be pretty easy to get. But, they would both be very valuable
    to my unit, and to myself. Likewise, they can be used in promotion
    boards, and generally speaking, would set me apart from many others.

-   Get jump wings - this might not be possible for me, due to
    physical (and financial) concerns, but damn it would be cool to wear
    those on my cammies.

-   Earn a volunteer service medal - Although not the most glorious
    medal to own, 100 hours of volunteer service isn't a lot per-se, but
    it would make me feel good about myself.

-   I want to be well known in my shop and unit - People should
    recognize me as someone trustworthy, hard working, strong, and
    admirable. I want people to respect me for where I've come from, and
    treat me like someone who earned it.

-   I should have 3 book reports done every year - I'm already a year
    behind, so I better play catch-up!

-   I should take English 1 & 2 - GySgt Joiner gave us really good
    advice at the end of MAEMC...I shouldn't pass that by.

-   I should have a ledger of impressionable material - not
    specifically awards or letters of appreciation, but a record of my
    work done correctly, and more than necessary; the material that
    distinguishes me from others in my shop, solely from my craft.

-   Help others reach my rank - it's my responsibility to pave the
    path for the next marines coming through my path; I have to give
    them a way to do so.

-   Buy a car - it will be hard getting around without a vehicle, and
    owning one would get me a lot of freedom.

-   Bolster your TSP - a retirement fund will be necessary 15 years
    from now; I would be foolish to waste that opportunity.

-   Save enough money to fund a company - this will be very difficult,
    but a lifelong goal of mine; to own a successful company. It will be
    very hard to do that without finance, and a great way to get started
    is with the funding received from the military. Likewise, having the
    connections here may be essential to getting Local Cooking off the
    ground.

-   Earn some cool challenge coins - it's hard to describe the value
    of these.

Interpersonal
-------------

No man is an island; no one person can achieve something great on their
own, and everyone has had some help at some point in their journey.
Working with other people is essential to succeeding in any endeavor;
military or otherwise. In order to achieve my long-term goal of starting
a business, I'll have to master the art of working with other people,
but before that, I'll need to inspire my Marines, and my chain of
command's trust.

-   Be admired - I want people to respect me for my proficiency and
    conduct; my character should inspire excellence in every respect.

-   Be approachable - I should always have the proper level of tact
    when working with anyone, no matter the subject of the interaction.

-   Practice the leadership traits and principals - Just as Colonel
    Tavouchis said, you can lead an honest life if you just follow your
    leadership traits and principals, and your general orders.

-   Know how to approach people - there are probably a lot of skills
    hidden in the book "how to make friends and influence people\".

-   Earn your reputation - I don't want to force people into having a
    preconception about me; I want everyone to learn who I am through
    their own accord.

-   Pay your dues - I want to be like Gunny Joiner; I want to respect
    the grind, and how to do the right thing regardless of the
    difficulty.

-   I want people to push themselves to reach my level - by example, I
    want people to see that not only can they improve, but it's only a
    matter of pushing yourself.

-   I want my word to be true - and to never forget something (or
    someone) I promise.

-   Accomplish what you're told - I also never want to forget what I
    am commanded to do; I want to lead my command as a difference in
    what they are used to working with.

-   Cooperate - I need to make sure I never step on my colleagues', or
    command's, toes.

-   Have initiative - I should be eager to do the right thing, at all
    times, and to keep-up on what I ought to be doing.

-   Take English 1 & 2 - this will help me a lot when writing emails
    and other documents, that may need to express many levels of
    emphasis at the same time, while showing dignity and respect to
    every reader.

Personal
--------

Doing things well is a good trait, but knowing that you're doing the
right thing is a step closer to wisdom.

- I'd like to build and own a company some day. What that company is
  and does, however, that is up for debate. But, I've been striving to
  do so for a very long time, and I have the potential to make it a reality;
  it would be a shame to miss out on an opportunity to do so.
- However, before I shoot for the stars, I need to ground myself and build
  a solid foundation - I need to do the following before anything else:

  - pay off my debt - I don't have much left, but in order for me to finance
    anything, I'll need to file for personal loans, and that won't be practical
    or possible without a good credit score. After this, I'll open a credit card,
    and further my credit development.
  - get a car - Relying on a bicycle will be good exercise, and decent free travel -
    but for anything large-scale, it's not practical.
  - get a formal education - potentially a certification (i.e., CompTIA, something
    COOL compatible), and an associates degree.
  - take English 1 & 2

- Set up a personal Gantt chart - both time-dependent, and independent - use pgfgantt
  
  - learning more about project management may help here - Agile and PMI may
    provide valuable utility.
    
- Meditate and build a more robust self-value - not in the sense of confidence
  or anything like that, but rather build habits and discipline that makes
  you proud of yourself; so you can be sure you didn't let yourself down.
  Maybe schedule self-help sessions.
- Determine how far you've come - do an audit of your past; your failures,
  and equally importantly, your successes. Figure out how you can utilize your
  habits to build a better future.
- Determine what is required of you on a time-based schedule, and decide what is worth
  sacrificing; putting off what can be delayed, and what is required and not optional.
- Determine what moderate goals, as extracurricular non-precedent activities, could be
  integrated into my goal-planning lifestyle to better acclimate to the scheduling
  techniques.
- Read "making friends and influencing people", in addition to many others - make my
  own reading list, and abide by it. Furthermore, as in the USMC category, write my
  reports.
- Explore the future of my career, and determine what would be valuable 10, 20, 30
  years from now.
- Build a discipline / protocol for accepting tasks and granting your word; it may
  help with focusing your task accomplishment, and gaining new ones. This may integrate
  with "A message for Garcia".
- It may be difficult organizing your goals with your command - reading MFAIP may help
  you gain tact when dealing with difficult situations, requiring flexibility.
