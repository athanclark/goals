General Ideas
-------------

Generally speaking, there are four major categories for the ideas just
discussed:

-   USMC Related - How will I spend my next four years in the Corps,
    how I can change it, and likewise how it could change me?

-   Interpersonal - How could I improve my professional and personal
    relationships with people; work better, be trustworthy, and gain
    more trust from people (where deserved)?

-   Personal - How should I decide the value and importance of certain
    goals? I should be capable of deciding which ones are worth
    prioritizing over others, whether personal or Corps related.

-   Productivity - I should always be trying to improve my workflow
    and accomplish tasks faster; furthermore, with better planning and
    decision making from the Personal category, I may improve how I
    process goals.
